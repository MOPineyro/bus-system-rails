## Readme

- Michael said: If you're not sure what to write, consider including your names, what problem or tool you are learning, how to use your project, known problems, a roadmap, and a license.

#### This exercise is similar to the train exercise we did previously, but we'll re-do it in Rails now. Here are some user stories to start out with:

1. -DONE- As a bus system operator, I want to add bus stations, so that I can show where all of the buses will go.
2. -DONE- As a bus system operator, I want to add bus lines, so that I can track which lines go to which stations.
3. - NEEDS TESTING - As a bus rider, I want to view a bus line, so that I can see the stations where it stops.
4. - NEEDS TESTING - As a bus rider, I want to view a bus station, so that I can see which buses come to it.


If you get through these first stories, here are a few more for you:

1. As a bus system operator, I want to add buses to a line, so that I can assign each physical bus to a particular line.
2. As a bus systems operator, I want to note what time a bus is scheduled to arrive at each stop, so that I can tell my drivers when they should be where.
3. As a bus rider, I want to view a bus line and see all of the buses that run on it and what time they arrive at each stop, so that I can pick one that fits my schedule.
4. As a bus rider, I want a visual representation of the bus system, so that I can more easily see which lines go where. Hint: Check out D3.js; don't overlook the d3-rails gem.
